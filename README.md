# The Project

This project is a creature grass search system made with Unreal Engine blueprint, with a trigger box that detects the character overlap action to check if it's moving inside him. And then, if there's movement, the box select randomly a number to see if it found the creature or not.

# Reference

My references were the AAA game POKEMON and the indie game TEMTEM, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - Firstly, I've created a trigger box to receive the character overlap action.

2.0 - After that, I've just made the logic to check if the character is moving inside of my trigger box, and with this movement, select a random number that, maybe, will be the chosen one to find the pokemon.
